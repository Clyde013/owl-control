# Preferred Games

You may have heard that we are offering to buy games for people so long as they commit to getting us a significant amount of data from that game.

The caveat with this is that we are choosing which games to buy to control the data mixture. We will only buy _preferred games_. While you can use the list below as reference, this refers to games that are:

- First-person
- High-quality/detailed (Need not be AAA/new, i.e. Crysis 3)
- Action-packed (doesn't need to be fighting, just lots of events happening beyond moving/looking around)

If you would like a game that fits these criteria and are willing to collect data for it, let us know and we can get you a key!

Note that not all games in the below list necessarily meet the above criteria, and that failing to meet this criteria does not make a game "bad data".

Some games support both first- and third-person mode; where possible, please play games in first-person mode.

Games marked as `(admin)` have been reported to require running OBS+OWL Control in administrator mode to record correctly. Please verify your recordings are not all-black when recording these games.
