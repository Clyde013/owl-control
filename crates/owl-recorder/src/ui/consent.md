## Purpose of Study

You are invited to participate in a research study aiming to collect combined game and control data for the purposes of training world models and subsequently AI agents. The curated dataset will be open sourced and made publicly available for research purposes. This software will record your game and inputs to potentially contribute to this dataset. There is no minimum required participation.

## Procedures

If you agree to participate our software will:

- Record your screen during gameplay sessions
- Log keyboard and mouse inputs
- Store this data for research purposes

## Data Collection and Privacy

- The recording software is limited to only capturing full screen applications.
- The recording software will stop recording if no activity is detected for a sufficient period of time.
- Further processing and cleaning will be done before any open source release. During this process, the data will be stored securely and anonymized.
- Upon full open source release, there will be no identifying information in the dataset.
- The software cannot record microphone audio
- The software records game audio only, not all desktop audio
- Data is stored locally and only uploaded when you manually press the upload button
- The software avoids recording overlays.

## Potential Risks

- Using OWL Control in multiplayer games may result in account bans, as anti-cheat systems may flag it as suspicious software
- We strongly recommend using OWL Control only in single-player games to avoid potential issues

## Voluntary Participation

Your participation is entirely voluntary. You may:

- Choose not to participate
- Stop recording at any time
- Request deletion of your recorded data
- Withdraw from the study without penalty

## Compensation

- There is no compensation for this study
